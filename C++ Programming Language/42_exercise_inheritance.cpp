    Q1. What type of inheritance are you using?
    -->Multiple Inheritance
    Q2. Which mode of inheritance are you using?
    -->public Inheritance
    Q3.Create an object of HybridCalculator and display result of simple and scientific calculator
    Q4. How is code reusibilty implemented
    -->By Hybrid Inheritance
