Inheritance in C++:

DRY-->Donot Repeat Yourself pricipal

-->Reusability is a very important feature of OOPs

-->In C++, we can reuse a class and add additional features to it

-->Reusing classes saves time and energy

-->Reusing already tested and debugged class will save a lot of effort of developing and debugging the same time again
*/

/*
Importance of Inheritance:

-->The concept of Reusibility in C++ is supported using Inheritance

-->We can reuse the properties of an existing 

-->The existing class is called as the Base Class

-->The new class which is inherited is called as Derived Class

-->There are different types of inheritance in C++
*/

/*
1.Single Inheritance: A derived with only one Base Class

2.Multiple Inheritance: A derived with more than one Base Class

3.Hierarchical Inheritance: Several derived classes from a single base class

4.Multilevel Inheritance: Deriving a class from already derived class

5.Hybrid Inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel Inheritance
--> A class is derived from two classes as in multiple inheritance

-->However, one of the parent classes is not a base class
