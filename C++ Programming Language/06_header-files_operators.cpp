/*
There are two types of header files:
1.System header files: It comes with the compiler
eg: #include<iostream>
3.User defined data types: It is written by the programmer
eg: #include"this.h":--> This will produce an error if this.h is not present in the current directory
*/

// So What is an Operator

// An operator is a symbol used to perform operations in given programming language

// 1. Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, %)
// 2. Relational Operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
// 3. Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)
// 4. Bitwise Operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
// 5. Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)
// 6. Increment/ Decrement Operators
